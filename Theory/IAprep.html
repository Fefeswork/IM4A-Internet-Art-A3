    <h3>IDEA 1</h3>
    
    The first idea is to create a collage of games I’m interested in and have the user hover over the game cover of their choice and it would provide them with some information about the game. This would be similar to the collage I created for my data art website in 2022. :

     Below is a reference to the idea I had in mind:

  <h3>IDEA 2</h3>
  
  The second idea is to create a game taking inspiration from Martin Gauer’s portfolio: 
  <br>https://martingauer.com/<br>
  I think this is an extremely cool way to display your portfolio- he uses a Gameboy with which the user can actually interact with and we get to explore his work. Not only does this portfolio website look cool, but it also caters to the aesthetic I want to use- it uses a game user interface which in turn provides and almost game-like experience for the user. Reference images of the portfolio website:

    <h3>TECHNICAL</h3>
    
    There aren’t technical concerns regarding the first idea because it I something that I have done before, the Gameboy was created purely using CSS which was something interesting to me because it functions as if it was created using JavaScript which is what I was afraid of as I am not fully confident with JavaScript. The second part would be how would I create the Gameboy to cater to the idea I had and not necessarily have the exact same idea as Gauer, for example, if I were to use this idea, how do I do about creating a game that speaks to ducks shooting each other, this was a major concern because I wouldn’t know where to begin. The idea then shifted to adding a Unity game/prototype that I have already created but I didn’t know how I would do that even after the research I have done. These concerns led to me attempting and then struggling to get them to function… which in turn led to me changing ,y idea completely.
