                    Looking back at the work I’ve presented; I would say the UI does its job but not effectively.
The UI does its job of communicating what the user is seeing and what the user can expect to
see when navigating the website. Although the UI seemed to look fine, it was not necessarily
an aspect I paid much attention to as the focus was to explore the technical side of the
assignment. I did however put some effort into the UI to create a user experience that
encapsulates what the website is about. I have also referred to the Knaflic reading to improve
on my UI/UX even though these readings speak specifically to data visualisation. The reading
has also helped me think about how you would display information to capture the user’s
attention and I felt like this works in terms of designing UI and not just for data visualisation
because good UI improves the user’s experience.
In the Knaflic reading Storytelling with data, although she speaks specifically about data
visualization, I have also taken the information from the reading and have considered it when
designing my wireframes and designing how I want the website to look and feel. “…we can
employ preattentive attributes to create visual hierarchy in our communications.” (Knaflic
2015: 108). By this quote, Knaflic is implying that using preattentive attributes plays a role in
the visual hierarchy of your design, essentially what the user sees first. In my UI there is
some kind of visual hierarchy in which I show what I want the user to see first, I did this by
using different font sizes, colours and in some cases changes in font-colours or fonts. When
looking at the UI I’ve presented there is a distraction which is the background image. From
the feedback, I’ve received the background image serves its purpose for the homepage, and
carrying it over to the other pages on the webpage seemed to be distracting as it did not work
well for the design of the page and therefore took away what the user is actually supposed to
focus on for that page. As Knaflic states in the reading: “Context is what needs to be present
for your audience in order for what you want to communicate to make sense” (Knaflic 2015:
132), this is something that I should’ve considered when designing the other pages of my
website. Although it may be easy to understand, my work felt a bit cluttered as I tried to
squeeze in as much information as I could in one space when I could’ve expanding this
information through to other pages, an example I can use from my work is the blog post page.
I haven’t established a flow for the page, taking into consideration that the page will be filled
with more theory blog posts, I simple pasted text from the first theory so that it is the first
thing that the user sees. This does work for this first prototype as it only had one blog post,
but it would’ve been helpful to think about how this would be overwhelming to the user, in
terms of having too much information on one page, once more theory blog posts are added to
the page.
Feedback reflection:From the feedback I’ve received these are a few things I need to
consider in future: the links for my pages need more space, I can see why this is an issue as the sizes of the links aren’t consistent and may look aesthetically unpleasant or the pages
feels clustered on some way.
With regards to my choices I’m fonts, it was mentioned these were inconsistent. To account
for this design decision, I wanted to explore whether it was wise to incorporate different fonts
or to keep the font consistent. After receiving the feedback, it has come to my attention that
the wise decision would be to keep the font consistent or ultimately use fonts that are close to
each other for a more creative and less awkward design.
Another point that was mentioned was with regards to my navigation, it was suggested that
maybe having some nab bar on each page would be useful. This is a great suggestion as in
my design I had a back button that would send the user back to the homepage each time the
clicked on it, this does seem tedious and very redundant and ultimately may make the user
want to stop engaging with the website all together.
