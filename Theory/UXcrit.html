                    The UI/UX for my website is decent. I think I did a good job presenting the information that I wanted to present to the user. With guidance from various readings and independent research, I was able to explore different ideas to create an accessible and aesthetically pleasing user interface. The UI does its job of communicating what the user is seeing and what the user can expect to see when navigating the website. I did however put some effort into the UI to create a user experience that encapsulates what the website is about- I began building my idea around the theme “treasure hunt game”. Centring my ideas around this theme helped me do more research on how I can create the aesthetic the way I want to.
I found myself turning back to an old reading: This being a reading by Knaflic ‘Chapter four: Focus your audience’s attention’ and ‘Chapter five: Think like a designer’, Storytelling with data. Although she speaks specifically about data visualization, I have also taken the information I learned from the reading and have taken it and considered it when designing my wireframes, my user flow, and content mapping as well as designing how I want the website to look and feel. “…we can employ preattentive attributes to create visual hierarchy in our communications.” (Knaflic 2015: 108).
As stated in the, The Basic Principles of User Interface Design reading we learn that  “A good user interface is critical to a good user experience.” (UXPin 2020). This is a statement I can agree with because if you present the user with good UI they are able to use the website. For my UI I did manage to follow a few basic principles of UI, these being: aiming to keep my design simple by following conventions that a familiar to the user. The design isn’t necessarily consistent; however, I do think that the user is able to predict how the website should behave. I think the colour palette and the other visual design elements I’ve used also enhance my overall UI. I do however feel like there were some failures during the design process such as: failing to put the user first- I often found myself designing the website based on what I thought looked good instead of focusing on what would the user think looks good. I also think I fell short with my accessibility design- the fonts I’ve used aren’t necessarily readable. It does get difficult to read the words when certain colours are used for the font chosen. I however did try to balance it by adding a font that is viewed to be accessible.
For the User experience, I think I’ve created a fairly decent UX. I’ve managed to create an almost game-like experience. The aim was to make it feel like a treasure hunt almost where the user explores different pages, going through the process of creating the website and internet art and finally getting to the end which is the internet art section where the player is greeted by a quick short internet web game. The UI complements the UX very well, as the UI makes it easier for the user to experience the website the way the theme of the website suggests.
