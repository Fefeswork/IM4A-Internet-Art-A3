                        The revision videos did help to a certain extent because the videos were so long and there was a lot of information packed in the videos, I found it very hard to stay focused throughout the entire time I was going through the videos. I often found myself losing my train of thought and always having to go back to rewatch the part of the video I missed. However, I do think that if I do go through the videos again during my own time, I will grasp all the information better as I am someone who needs to go through content more than once to fully understand the work and not just go through content for the sake of going through it and not understanding it.
        
                        For this week’s work, I don’t necessarily have technical questions as of yet, I’ve gone back to the basics that I am comfortable with ie. Just simply create pages for my website, wireframing and play around with CSS. I do think that once I continue working on my website and adding new things, I would have questions that may help me improve my technical work.
                        
                        Internet art is an interesting concept, however, I do feel like I still don’t fully understand what it is. I do get a sense of what it might be but I’m not confident enough to share knowledge or my thoughts about net art. I do think that I need to engage with it more and look into my peers’ thoughts about it so I can help myself understand the concept. With that being said I do think I am struggling to see the point of internet art and exploring its beauty of it. Having looked through the resources given for the week I’m having a hard time forming an interest in these works was a challenge this week- this circles back to me not fully understanding the concept of net/web art.
                        
                        I quite liked the readings. It was very interesting that the Carrier reading refers to “The work of mechanical reproduction” by Walter Benjamin which was a reading we had done last year in our theory class. I did go back to the reading and remembered how Benjamin speaks about aura and how it changes when an artwork is reproduced. From my understanding in turn how art is shifting from an analogue space into a digital space.
                        
                        For my work, I would first like to first understand what is meant by internet art, further engage with internet artworks then explore ideas that may come to mind. I currently do not know what I would like to do for my internet art website as it still feels like a mystery to me.
