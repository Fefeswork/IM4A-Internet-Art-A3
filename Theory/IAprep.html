    <h3>IDEA 1</h3>
    
    The first idea is to create a collage of games I’m interested in and have the user hover over the game cover of their choice and it would provide them with some information about the game. This would be similar to the collage I created for my data art website in 2022. : 
    <br> https://fefeswork.github.io/IM-3B/ <br>
     Below is a reference to the idea I had in mind:

  <h3>IDEA 2</h3>
  
  The second idea is to create a game taking inspiration from Martin Gauer’s portfolio: 
  <br>https://martingauer.com/<br>
  I think this is an extremely cool way to display your portfolio- he uses a Gameboy with which the user can actually interact with and we get to explore his work. Not only does this portfolio website look cool, but it also caters to the aesthetic I want to use- it uses a game user interface which in turn provides and almost game-like experience for the user. Reference images of the portfolio website:

    <h3>TECHNICAL</h3>
    
    There aren’t technical concerns regarding the first idea because it I something that I have done before, the Gameboy was created purely using CSS which was something interesting to me because it functions as if it was created using JavaScript which is what I was afraid of as I am not fully confident with JavaScript. The second part would be how would I create the Gameboy to cater to the idea I had and not necessarily have the exact same idea as Gauer, for example, if I were to use this idea, how do I do about creating a game that speaks to ducks shooting each other, this was a major concern because I wouldn’t know where to begin. The idea then shifted to adding a Unity game/prototype that I have already created but I didn’t know how I would do that even after the research I have done. These concerns led to me attempting and then struggling to get them to function… which in turn led to me changing ,y idea completely.

    <h3>REFLECTION</h3>
    
    “Net Art’s spectrum is so wide that it is difficult to define…”(Ricci, 2020).<br>

For the internet art, I decided to create a website game that mimics the idea of a whack-a-mole game:

<br>
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/learnersbucket.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ezgif.com-optimize-9.gif?fit=450%2C221&ssl=1"style="width:60%">
<br>
For my idea, this concept would be used however instead of whacking a mole you are collecting treasure. Images of a treasure chest with gold in it would pop upon different grid plots of board and the player would click on it to score points, eventually, a pirate hat would appear and if the player clicks on it the game ended meaning they’d lost their treasure to pirates.
Technically I used guidance from various websites to help the game function the way I wanted it to, I managed to make use of JavaScript to create this game. Technically the guidance from the different sources I used helped ease my concerns and created this was quite enjoyable. However when the site was deployed there were issues with the game functioning, I wasn’t quite sure what the issue was because all the script referencing was correct, I tried other methods and it still wouldn’t work once the site was deployed on GitHub which in turn “ruins” the experience I wanted to create.
This idea helped me create the game experience I wanted as I view web games as a form of internet art, with the idea  wanted to work with- I wanted  to create a sense of exploration for the user so that once they reach the internet art section it almost feels like they are close to finding the treasure and then they are introduced to a game where they have to collect the treasure and they would feel accomplished.
