                      Internet art is an interesting concept, due to the rapid shift from traditional art to a more digital society we have seen the world shift into a more technological space. With art, we are starting to see more artists produce digital works that they post online for internet users to look at and engage. The concept of art circles back to a reading which I had done- The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction by Walter Benjamin where Benjamin speaks on art shifting from a traditional form to a digital space and how the aura of an artwork changes and evolves due to how it [the artwork] adapts to these changes.
                      This essay will analyse a Martin Gauer’s portfolio website which I found interesting as it because it tackles my interest in UI/UX as well as what I like to do and content that interests me. Gauer uses an interesting way of displaying what he does, and his achievements while offering a unique user experience that resembles a gamey feel. The essay will first define my understanding of internet art with reference to the theoretical framework readings and the extra research I have done. It will then break down the Internet artwork that I have chosen and provide insight into the Internet as a medium in the work while also adding to what makes this Internet art interesting to me.
                      “Net Art’s spectrum is so wide that it is difficult to define…”(Ricci, 2020). One can agree with this statement because there is no set definition for what internet art is. Depending on how one understands it internet art can simply be defined as art that you find on the internet. However, having done more research and actually engaged with different works internet can be whatever you want it to be, what I mean by that is one can take a look at an artwork on the internet and allow themselves to form a concept or understand the concept of what is being presented to them whilst being provided with aesthetics. Internet art can be seen as something that is meant to be an experience due to the medium that is being used.
                      Another interesting definition which I found from the PCMag Encyclopaedia is as follows “Artwork rendered on the Internet that the user interacts with in some manner. Internet art may include sound, animations and video…” (https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/internet-art). This is the definition that acknowledges my understanding of net art after engaging with multiple artworks and in turn trying to create my own artwork while also understanding how it works in the medium[website]. 
                      From looking at my own work from the previous year I would consider my website internet art because of the concept I tried to implement, what I did to implement my concept as well as how I wanted to implement the aesthetic as well because I attempt to mimic a game aesthetic and concept for the content of my website by using multiple theoretical frameworks and applying them to my website to produce a successful project. Internet art however does require/include more than just the art itself, “…it includes different manifestations ranging from scripts, and lines of code, to web browsers, algorithms, and search engines.” (Ricci, 2020).
                      The journal article by Mailloux touches on how innovations come as a surprise to the people and the medium (1983: 399). This means that people always get surprised when they interact with innovations as this influences their constructed social norms, which in this case we can refer to as "social conventions" (Mailloux, 1983: 400). These conventions are behaviours that the society sees as normal and how everyone should act regularly. The innovation then shocks the medium since it will have new algorithms that will affect how the system functions and how users understand and engage with it. Gauer’s work provides a different convention as his work behaves differently from that of a regular website however still follows the conventions of a regular website.
                      Gauer has an extremely interesting concept for the portfolio he has presented. He provides the user with an experience that links back to his interests and what he does and specializes in essentially centring and including game elements in his portfolio. He presents the user with a display of a game boy which the user can interact with on the homepage, once the user switches it on it ‘unlocks new content that the user can take a look at. How this resonates with me on a conceptual level is it has allowed me to answer the one question “How can I create a game experience through a website without it being an actual website game?”. 
                      Referring back to the PCMag encyclopaedia definition of net art we can acknowledge that Martin Gauer has attempted to render an experience, in this case, would be instead of just playing an entire web game he also simply follows the conventions of a regular website where the user scrolls down to read information or access information. When interacting with the game boy almost the same can be said, when the user interacts with something or someone in the mini-game we are taken to a new page where we are provided with more content which makes the game boy behave similarly to a website.
                      The aesthetics on the website provide a gamey aesthetic from the fonts and the behaviour of the UI elements. The way the UI elements behave is interesting as it behaves as it would in a regular video game, this is seen with the side navigation that the user can use to navigate the website. When the user hovers over the work there is a colour background that shows around the text showing that the user can click on it to go to a different page, the way it appears is similar if not exactly how it would be in a video game. Gauer balances the gamey fonts and a regular not-so-gamey font, this balances out well as the fonts don’t clash with each other but rather complement each other without shying away from the given aesthetic. The balance and alignment of the content, although the content was placed in different locations it follows a consistent alignment of text the placement of the mini-game boy discs and the spacing of each element. 
                      From a technical standpoint, it is quite interesting how Gauer has used mostly CSS and HML for most of his website and then uses JS for the event handling. What was even more interesting is that the game boy he has included is only CSS code which made me question why and how this had been done. This then had me circling back to the Danae reading where a section speaks on new aesthetics centring around how “… James Bridle, an academic specialising in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, wished to bring attention to the systems underlying artistic productions.” (Danae, 2019). This essentially speaks on how aesthetics can be looked at from not only a ‘looks’ point of view but also from how the look is created- meaning the code and how the underlying systems work as well as the technological system[apparatus] works to produce a said aesthetic. The navigation system is also quite interesting in terms of how it behaves, he has used side navigation that once the user clicks on a link instead of it sending the user to a new page it is used as an auto-scroll navigation. You would think that it would redirect the user to a different page, however, it makes the code neater in terms of making sure that the navigation works smoothly.
