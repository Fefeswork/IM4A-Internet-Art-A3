        <h1>DESIGN CHOICES:</h1>
      

            <!-------------------------------------------------WIREFRAMES----------------------------------------------------------------------->

            <article>
    <div class="wireframe">
      <h3>Wireframes</h3>
      
      <h4>Homepage:</h4>

      Final choice: Design 2
      I decided to use the second design because I wanted the user to admire the aesthetic more. With the first design, I would’ve just placed an image to fill the negative space and it wouldn’t have been done with a purpose or meaning. I personally like the second design because it allowed me to play around with the negative space and my imagination in terms of what meaningful design choice could I take to elevate the experience from the moment I see the screen.

<h4>Design & Theory Pages:</h4>

Final choice: design 1
For my design page and theory page I decided to make the wireframes the same for these pages<br>
because I think this is where the user would do the most exploring in terms of viewing/choosing content[to view].

<img src="../IMGs/DesignSec2.png"style="width: 50%">

<h4>Blogs:</h4>

Final choice: Design 1
The blogs I wanted to keep it simple. This is the wireframe design that I always turn to, I’m still yet to find a creative way to display the different blog cards I didn’t want to follow the same wireframe as the design. Theory pages because it felt a bit too overwhelming for the users that were testing/exploring my site.
<img src="../IMGs/Blogs.png"style="width: 50%">

<div class="white">
<h4>Styleguide:</h4>

Final choice: Design 1
I decided to make one design for the styleguide section becuase i thought it was a creative design and it almost resembles a book. I made use of an image slider to create a 'book' so that the use can 'flip through the book' and discover new information about the general website.
<img src="../IMGs/SG.png"style="width: 50%">

<h4>Startpage:</h4>

Final choice: Design 1
For the very first page which is labelled as the start page, I decided to go with the only design I created which was a game-like start page. It serves as a welcome page before heading to the 'main menu' of the website. I think it is a creative way to showcase a website ina gamey way.
<img src="../IMGs/Welcome Page.png"style="width: 50%">

<h4>IxD Doc and IA prep:</h4>

Final choice: Design 1
For these pages, I decided to leave these as regular pages similar to that the dev blog posts.This makes it easier to play around with how i would like to place reference images.

          <!-------------------------------------------------VISUAL DESIGN ELEMENTS----------------------------------------------------------------------->

          <article>
    <div class="vd-elements">
      <h3>VISUAL DESIGN ELEMENTS</h3>
      
      <h4>Contrast:</h4>
    Regarding the contrast for the visual design the coloulr palette uses colours that complement eachother well. There are different shades of browns hints of white and black throughout the website. 
    Although i wanted to work with these shades being darker than they actually are i often found colour clashes within the colour palette I've chosen- for example some colours would be too dark others
    too light of the background would not gel well with the colour palette. I've chosen to keep my colour palette simple and use colours that are simialr or might work well with the backgrounds and font style etc.
      
      <h4>Scale:</h4>
      The scaling was a bit difficult to work with as some items were too small and some were too big, i had to figure out a way to balance everything out. I decided to keep most of the things on the website at the same scale. This reduced the large amounts of negative space that were present and in tern improved the overall balance of the website.
      
      <h4>Balance:</h4>
      Balance was crucial for the style guide section and the Internet art section. For the internet art section, it was important to keep the spacing between the flip card even to avoid showing that a card could potentially be viewed as more important. To evenly balance out everything I decided to go with an even number of flip cards, not only did it make the 'game' look good and well-balanced it also improved the overall visual aesthetic of the internet art as it looked neat.
    
    <h4>Fonts & Colours:</h4>

    Times New Roman
     I’ve decided to use times new Roman because it’s a font that compliments the aesthetic of my website. It gives the website a more medieval feel without it looking too fancy.
    It is a font that I turn to on many occasions if I want to add a fancy touch to my text and it is also an accessible font- it is easy to read and there is a clear distinction between the letters.
    
    
    Font colour:
    
    I’ve chosen to use the colour black and white for some text because it works well with the colour palette I’ve chosen. It’s not too overwhelming and it isn’t overshadowed by the colours of the colour palette.
    It also compliments the chosen font well as it solidifies the look and feels that I want my content to have when the user looks at it. I have also made use of the green and turquoise like colours for the fonts.
