    <h3>IDEA 1</h3>
    
    The first idea is to create a collage of games I’m interested in and have the user hover over the game cover of their choice and it would provide them with some information about the game. This would be similar to the collage I created for my data art website in 2022. :

  <h3>IDEA 2</h3>
  
  The second idea is to create a game taking inspiration from Martin Gauer’s portfolio: 
  <br>https://martingauer.com/<br>
  I think this is an extremely cool way to display your portfolio- he uses a Gameboy with which the user can actually interact with and we get to explore his work. Not only does this portfolio website look cool, but it also caters to the aesthetic I want to use- it uses a game user interface which in turn provides and almost game-like experience for the user. Reference images of the portfolio website:

    <h3>TECHNICAL</h3>
    
    There aren’t technical concerns regarding the first idea because it I something that I have done before, the Gameboy was created purely using CSS which was something interesting to me because it functions as if it was created using JavaScript which is what I was afraid of as I am not fully confident with JavaScript. The second part would be how would I create the Gameboy to cater to the idea I had and not necessarily have the exact same idea as Gauer, for example, if I were to use this idea, how do I do about creating a game that speaks to ducks shooting each other, this was a major concern because I wouldn’t know where to begin. The idea then shifted to adding a Unity game/prototype that I have already created but I didn’t know how I would do that even after the research I have done. These concerns led to me attempting and then struggling to get them to function… which in turn led to me changing ,y idea completely.

    <h3>REFLECTION</h3>
    
    “Net Art’s spectrum is so wide that it is difficult to define…”(Ricci, 2020).<br>

For the internet art, I decided to create a website game that mimics the idea of a whack-a-mole game:

<br>
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/learnersbucket.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ezgif.com-optimize-9.gif?fit=450%2C221&ssl=1"style="width:60%">
<br>
For my idea, this concept would be used however instead of whacking a mole you are collecting treasure. Images of a treasure chest with gold in it would pop upon different grid plots of board and the player would click on it to score points, eventually, a pirate hat would appear and if the player clicks on it the game ended meaning they’d lost their treasure to pirates.
Technically I used guidance from various websites to help the game function the way I wanted it to, I managed to make use of JavaScript to create this game. Technically the guidance from the different sources I used helped ease my concerns and created this was quite enjoyable. However when the site was deployed there were issues with the game functioning, I wasn’t quite sure what the issue was because all the script referencing was correct, I tried other methods and it still wouldn’t work once the site was deployed on GitHub which in turn “ruins” the experience I wanted to create.
This idea helped me create the game experience I wanted as I view web games as a form of internet art, with the idea  wanted to work with- I wanted  to create a sense of exploration for the user so that once they reach the internet art section it almost feels like they are close to finding the treasure and then they are introduced to a game where they have to collect the treasure and they would feel accomplished.

<!-------------------------------------------------FINAL UPDATE----------------------------------------------------------------------->
<article>
  <div class="reflection">
    <h3>IDEA 3</h3>
    After receiving some feedback and reflecting on my internet art I started to explore more ideas but also making sure that I stick to the theme.

For my third idea, I thought of a dress-up game, almost like a create-your-own adventurer/ character because it aligns with my general idea for the website: using game UI to create a game-like experience.

-	In terms of the technical aspect of this idea I wasn’t sure where to start because most of the guidance I had researched most of the code was C# and I wasn’t sure how I was going to get it to work on my website.  I did eventually find a way to create something like this and it was partially working.

<h3> IDEA 4:</h3>

Another idea I had was to create a platformer game. The concept is still the same as my first internet idea which would was collect the treasure in the form of ‘whack a mole’. In this game the player would be moving around a level where they collect the treasure. The goal would simply be to collect all the treasure in the level. Another idea I had for this game was to have the player collect the treasure and once they have done so, new content would be ‘unlocked’.

-	In terms of the technical aspect of this game/ concerns, I’m worried that the game would not function the way I would like to and the idea of having new content unlock is a really cool idea however on a technical front I feel like I would struggle with getting it to work once the site is deployed.

<h3> FINAL INTERNET ART REFLECTION:</h3>

FINAL INTERNET ART REFLECTION:
 For my final internet art I’ve decided to keep my first idea for- this being the ‘whack a mole’/ collect the treasure game as well as my new idea- that being character creator tool for my internet art. I have chosen to do so because I think it’s a nice way to give the user liberty to choose what they would like to look at or engage with. It also works hand in hand with the theme of treasure hunt/ exploring for the website, in essence the user is exploring the internet art I’ve presented.

 <br>
-	On a technical aspect I’ve done a lot of hunting from various sources to help me achieve the idea I had for my internet art; it was hard to fins something that helped me fix the technical issues I was already having with my technical work which affected the creative aspect of my project. I eventually found some sources which helped me alleviate my issue. I’d like to give credit and reference the following sites and works that contributed to my overall internet art ideas:
