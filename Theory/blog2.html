                      I never knew what an API was, and I tried hard to understand what it was, but I couldn’t 

                      It was something that I really struggled with implementing and I still feel like I don’t fully understand what it is and how to implement it properly. After gaining some understanding of what APIs are I find them quite interesting- how they allow me to draw information from a large space of data and use that information to create something of my own. I remember using an API relating to information about games and so forth for my final exam last year (a very serious task that was very draining to execute but I did it). The only downside about APIs was that I have to use JavaScript which is something I still struggle with a bit but I’m being patient with myself so I can grasp it without any pressure and for the sake of grasping it.
                      
                      My thoughts on the reading- confused! I think it may potentially be because I overthink everything which isn’t always a bad thing but it comes at times when I don’t need to overthink a topic. In the end, I did manage to actually understand what everyone is talking about-yay!! Steven Mailloux’s reading made me think about conventions which were something I don’t always think about, some conventions are understood the same but, in the end, we all interpret things differently. As stated in the reading conventions refer to a “shared practice” which is a statement I agree with because many things we do in society share similarities.
                      
                      Internet art has started to grow on me after finding out I can make it whatever I wanted to be. With Iman’s help, I felt more confident with my ideas and started exploring them further. With the help and guidance of previous student works I felt a little more inspired and motivated to like internet art because all the works looked so good, and I feel a bit more comfortable running with my idea. At first, I took a look at #PAYBLACKTiME by Rafia Santana https://raf-i-a.tumblr.com/post/153188418768/payblacktime-is-my-white-money-transferenceLinks to an external site. - this looked good to me and the message behind it resonated with me so much because I am a black woman myself and I understand the struggle from personal experience and listening to people’s stories and doing my own research. I wanted to do something similar and use my internet art to talk about something or explore a topic, but I didn’t feel as passionate about it and not many ideas came to mind. I did end up changing my idea to something I really like:
                      
                       My idea is to make a ‘gamey’ website because I like games and I’ve always wanted to explore how I can make a website a game but it’s not really a game because it’s a website. Doing research for this is quite difficult because there really isn’t a name for what I want to do or let me say just say I don’t know where to look. I started with researching what kind of feel I want my website to have- for example do I want it to feel like a horror game or adventure game and so forth. I may need a little extra guidance because I feel like I may be too ambitious for some reason (I’m nervous about the code that I may have to tackle).
                      
                       
                      
                      I think now I have an idea of what internet art is and what I would like to do, it all comes down to how will I execute it and I should just start and run with my idea.
